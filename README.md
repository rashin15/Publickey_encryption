# Publickey_encryption
In this practical scenario, i was asked with demonstrating public key encryption, security, and digital signatures.
The exercise involves two systems, each containing two folders.
Initially, asymmetric key pairs are generated for both entities along with sample data for encryption using symmetric keys. 
The public keys are exchanged between the systems.
Digital signatures are then generated for both entities, adding an extra layer of security to the data. 
Subsequently, the encrypted data is sent and decrypted. 
To automate the process, a bash script is created, showcasing the entire encryption and decryption sequence. 
In conclusion, i had successfully execute a comprehensive encryption scenario, encompassing key generation, data encryption, digital signatures, and automation using a bash script.
